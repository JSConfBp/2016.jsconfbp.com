  <h2 id="discover-budapest">Discover Budapest</h2>
  <p>Often described as the &quot;Little Paris of Middle Europe&quot;, Budapest is famous not only for the monuments reflecting its own 1,000-year-old culture, but also for the relics of others who settled here before that. The capital has two sides, Buda and Pest, stretching along the banks of the Danube, representing two different characters of the city.</p>

  <p>Buda and its historic castle district offer medieval streets, houses, thermal baths, museums, even caves and Roman ruins. The dynamic Pest side boasts the largest parliament building in Europe, riverside promenades, flea markets, bookstores, café houses and the ruin-pubs.
  Budapest was recently listed within the top 6 cities in Europe, best suited for startups.</p>
