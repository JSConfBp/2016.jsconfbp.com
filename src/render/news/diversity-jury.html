  In the Diversity Program, we, the organizers, do not decide who gets these tickets.
  Instead, we dedicate this task to those, who work hard to improve diversity in tech.

  This year the jury who evaluated the applications and awarded the Diversity Sponsoring tickets was <strong>Green Fox Academy</strong>.
