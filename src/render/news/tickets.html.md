 We're putting together a budget, for our Diversity Sponsorship program.
 This budget will be formed from financial support by companies, and sponsorship-valued tickets.

 Sponsorship-valued tickets contain a portion of a sponsored ticket, for example, if you buy a Regular Coder + 50% Diversity support ticket, you sponsored 50% of someone’s ticket who’s in need.

 More information on this Diversity Sponsorship program will come in the upcoming days.
