Our very first batch of tickets will be available for sale from 6th December, 10:00 AM CET.
<br />Follow us on [twitter](https://twitter.com/jsconfbp) for the exact announcement!

We would like to put together a budget, for our upcoming Diversity Sponsorship program.
This budget will be formed from financial support by companies, and sponsorship-valued tickets.

Sponsorship-valued tickets contain a portion of a sponsored ticket, for example, if you buy an Early Bird + 50% Diversity support ticket, you sponsored 50% of someone’s ticket who’s in need.

More information on this Diversity Sponsorship program will come in the upcoming days.

The tickets will be available at these prices:

 * Early Bird tickets <br />100 EUR + VAT + Fees = **133 EUR**

 * Early Bird tickets + 25% Diversity support <br />100 + 25 EUR + VAT + Fees = **166 EUR**

 * Early Bird tickets + 50% Diversity support <br />100 + 50 EUR + VAT + Fees = **199 EUR**

 * Early Bird tickets + 75% Diversity support <br />100 + 75 EUR + VAT + Fees = **233 EUR**

 * **Early Bird Combo!** JS + CSS, two conferences together ([CSSConf Budapest](http://cssconfbp.rocks/))<br />100 + 80 EUR + VAT + Fees = **239 EUR**
