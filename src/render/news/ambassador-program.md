<p>
  We aim to help developer communities out there, by our Ambassador Program. We provide a <strong>â‚¬50 discount coupon code</strong> for every community, who applies. For every <strong>5 ticket</strong> sold with this coupon code, we provide <strong>a free ticket</strong> for the ambassador who applied for the coupon.
</p>

<p>
  This free ticket then can be awarded to a community/meetup/usergroup member, or make it as a prize in a contest, it's up to the awarded group.

  If you organize a meetup or usergroup, apply here:
