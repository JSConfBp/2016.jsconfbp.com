<p>
  In an industry that is so focused frameworks & tooling, we tend to lose sight
  of the people behind the products and how we work with them. Iâ€™ve found empathy
  to be a powerful resource while collaborating with teams inside companies and
  across the open source community. By breaking down The Other Side of Empathy,
  I will demonstrate how applying its principles to your development process will
  benefit the community and the products they create.
