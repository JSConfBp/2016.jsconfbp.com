  The way we interacted with computers on a large scale was stuck in place for
  roughly 20 years. From mouse to keyboard to joystick, it is game over. Today
  it is the era of gestures. Today’s gamers can do everything from slice and
  dice produce in Fruit Ninja to quest for a dragon in Skyrim. We’ve been
  captivated by these powerful, natural, and intuitive interactions; imagining
  what it would be like to have that power at our own fingertips.

  In this recent decade, we’ve seen some staggering advances in technologies bring us closer
  making these magical experiences a reality. In this talk I will present how we
  can create new, intuitive, interactions for these novel input devices using JavaScript.
