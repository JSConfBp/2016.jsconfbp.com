  Ever lose out on a good night's rest because your pesky cats keep waking you up
  at 4am for food? Rachel has. Many times. For her first project using node, socket.io,
  microcontrollers, and johnny-five, Rachel built a web-based feeder that delivers
  tasty cat chow on a configurable schedule or when triggered remotely. She'll walk
  you through her learning process and get you excited about trying new things in
  your own projects. Finally, she'll show you how to take the first steps to release
  your work to the open source community.
