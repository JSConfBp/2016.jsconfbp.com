<p>
  Most React-Flux applications just store the data being edited as is in a database.
  While it is perfectly fine to treat data in a simple CRUD fashion like this with
  a smaller application this is not very optimal when applications get more complex.
  For more complex applications using the Command Query Responsibility Segregation
  (CQRS) design pattern together with Event-Sourcing (ES) is a much more powerful
  solution.
</p>
<p>
  With Event-Sourcing every action leading up to the current state is
  stored as a separate domain event. This collection of domain events is then used
  as the write model in the CQRS model. These same events are projected out to a
  secondary database to build the read model for the application. In this session
  Maurice de Beijer will explain why you might want to use Event-Sourcing and how
  to get started with this design in your React and Flux applications.
