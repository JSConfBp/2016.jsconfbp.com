<p>
  Load a page in less than a second; reduce the number of server requests; keep your
  CSS and JS merged and compressed to keep them under 50 kilobytes” – these are just a
  few among technical solutions and recommendations we are getting in the industry to
  tackle performance issues. But there is one catch – your users don’t care about
  absolute values in kilobytes, milliseconds and number of requests.
</p>
<p>
  Performance is not about Mathematics. Performance is about Perception. Perception
  is what makes a site with a very few requests nevertheless feel slow, while a site
  that delivers search results during tens of seconds can feel fast enough for your user.
  User’s perception of your website’s speed is the only true performance measure.
</p>
<p>
  This talk is about perception, neuroscience and psychology. The time is ripe to
  understand performance from the user’s perspective.
