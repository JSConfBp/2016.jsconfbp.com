  You've heard it before: It works on my machine" and you know the punchline
  "so your problem isn't real". Sometimes a bug just won't appear on your system:
  computers are fickle beasts full of subtlety. Humans too, but more so:
  we have habits, preferences, biases, our background, opportunities vary wildly.
  And even the technology industry itself is a perfect example of legacy spaghetti
  code (without unit tests), and this makes it very hard to debug for a better future.

<p>
  In this talk we will look at the many facets that affect our decision making and
  interactions in general, and work out how we can change for the better. Together,
  we will take a look at the effects that our software has on the daily lives of
  the thousands of people who are using it. We’ll examine how unconscious actions
  affect our work, and what part emotions and power dynamics play in it. You’ll
  learn what you can do as an individual to support change into a positive direction,
  and how you can help debug this system and make a difference in the tech industry – a
  nd why being better at bug handling means being better at working with humans.
  You’ll leave knowing about practical things you can do in your daily life to
  make tech a better, more inclusive and diverse environment that is a better
  place for everyone – including you.
