<p>
Unlike C and other low-level programming languages, Javascript takes away the pain
of memory management and garbage collection from the programmer. However, this doesn't
mean that developers shouldn't be aware of the memory management and garbage collection
implementation details of the Javascript programming language. Indeed, knowledge of
both of those things can go a long way towards improving the performance of code.

<p>
This talk will take beginners through an exploration of Javascript's garbage collector
and memory allocation implementations and their implications on how performant code
should be written. Attendees will leave this talk having gained insights into
the under-the-hood operations of Javascript and how they can leverage them to
produce performant code.
