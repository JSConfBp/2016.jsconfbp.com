<p>
  What even makes sense in Javascript?
</p>
<p>
  For a language originally created in 10 days it surely has a lot of quirks and perks
  many JS developers are unaware of. Sometimes, it might even seem like we fell down
  the rabbit hole only to find that NaN is actually a Number, undefined can be defined,
  +!![] equals 1, Array.sort()may not work as you suspected and so much other nonsense
  that can trip any JS developer’s mind.
</p>
<p>
  This talk is a collection of Javascript’s oddities and unexpected behaviors that
  hopefully will prevent some future headaches and help understand the language that
  we all love in a more deeper and meaningful way.
