<p>
  	You’re on a train to work and you open up the Guardian app on your phone.
    A tunnel surrounds you, but the app still works in very much the same way
    as it usually would—despite your lack of internet connection, you still get
    the full experience, only the content shown will be stale. If you tried the
    same for the Guardian website, however, it wouldn’t load at all. Native apps
    have long had the tools to deal with these situations, in order to deliver
    rich user experiences whatever the user’s situation may be.
    With service workers, the web is catching up. This talk will explain how
    Oliver used service workers to build an offline page for theguardian.com.
