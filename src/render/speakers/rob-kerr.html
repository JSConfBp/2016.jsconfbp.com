<p>
  Open-science is about making scientific research accessible to everyone,
  from other scientists to the general public, but often that means just
  dumping data sets and publishing the researchers' interpretations. To truly
  communicate findings and ignite collaboration, we need to expose the tools
  that the scientists used to analyse the data, simulate the mathematical models,
  and visualise the results. As a neuroscientist and a web developer,
  this is something I've been working towards.

  My talk will show how the old-school, computationally-heavy software used in
  science can be set free using the centralized power of cloud resources and
  the ubiquity of the browser. We'll see real-time, publicly-broadcast,
  simulations of the electrical activity in brain cells, visualised in 3D using Javascript.
