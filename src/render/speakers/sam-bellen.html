  As a guitar player, I usually use some effect-pedals to change the sound of my guitar.
  I started wondering: “What if, it would be possible to recreate these pedals
  using the web-audio-api?”. Well, it turns out, it is entirely possible to do so.

  This talk takes you through the basics of the web-audio-api and explains some of
  the audio-nodes I’ve used to change the live sound of my guitar.
