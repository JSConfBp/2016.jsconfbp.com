<p>
  HTTP - the way how clients and servers talk to each other on the internet -
  just got a major update. The first update in 15 years! HTTP/2 has landed and
  promises solutions to all the current performance workarounds we have for web
  applications: no more image sprites, no more concatenation, no domain sharding
  tricks. Just deploy like it's 1999! Well, that's at least what we got promised...
</p>
<p>
  In this session, we will explore the major features of the new HTTP version and
  its implications for todays JavaScript developers. We will critically analyze
  recommendations for deployment strategies and find out which impact they have
  on our current applications, as well as on the applications to come.
