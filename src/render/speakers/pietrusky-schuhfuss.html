<p>
  I love music since I can remember. I love to play the drums. I love to attend
  music festivals. I love to listen music on SoundCloud. But what I love the most
  is the Web, because it offers everything we need to be creative with music:
</p>

* Compose and produce music in the browser
* Use external MIDI hardware like a Drumpad, mini Piano or DJ-Controller
* Create real-time music visualizations
* Perform a live show and interact with the audience"
