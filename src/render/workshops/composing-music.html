<p>
  You can be a part of a musical experiment where we all send musical notes to a polyphonic modular synthesizer with the help of WebSockets and Web MIDI API. I expect to make some cheerful sounds together. I will talk a little bit about the Web MIDI, my attempt to wrap it with a much simpler API, and how it could be used for controlling - not just only MIDI instruments, but any hardware which has a USB port and able to understand MIDI messages.
