<p>
  Frontend developers creating single-page, stateful applications has a lot of challenge to overcome.
  To do so we can learn from other technologies that already has some answers for these problems and
  try to implement it on our environment, the browser.
</p>
<p>
  This workshop is about using a strongly-typed language with transpiling, targeting cross-platform environments,
  building modular architectures and providing solutions for common pitfalls. During this workshop we will play
  around with the Haxe language using the hexMachina MVC framework, spiced with smart code designs,
  focused on structuring long life-cycle applications.
