<p>
  Are you interested in Angular 2 but don’t know how to prepare your existing application for the migration? In this workshop we will guide you through an interesting journey from an old-school AngularJS code to a modern and decent one which is only one step far from an Angular 2 application. You will meet with the concepts of Web Components, Smart and Dump Components, controller-less code, decorators and the new data flow processes. This event will present what was the intentions behind the changes of the new Angular and how you should refactor your application to make the migration easier. At the end of the day we will make the final little step and switch the refactored application into an Angular 2 one.
