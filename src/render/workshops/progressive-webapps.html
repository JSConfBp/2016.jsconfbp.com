<h3>
  Crash course on Progressive Web Apps
</h3>

<p>
  Nolan Lawson will lead a workshop demonstrating how to create an fast, immersive mobile app, built entirely with web technologies. Using Service Workers, App Manifests, IndexedDB, Web Workers, and other cutting-edge APIs, we'll build a high-quality app that has its own icon, can be launched from the home screen, and works well across all modern browsers.
