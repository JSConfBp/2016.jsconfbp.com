	<h2 id="diversity-sponsorship">Diversity Sponsorship</h2>

	<p>We aim to help underrepresented groups in tech to attend and lowering the barriers for them.
	This includes but isn’t limited to: women, people of color, LGBTQIA+ people, and disabled people.
	We would like to give them a chance.</p>

	<p>To help them, we provide a <strong>limited number of free, Diversity Sponsored tickets</strong>.</p>

	<p class="text-centered">
		<a href="https://docs.google.com/a/ustream.tv/forms/d/15iDO_Ak34_vt6lzLNmEESAHvYBrZSuY3w2Ngkqewf3M/viewform" class="button red">Apply now</a>
	</p>

	<p>These tickets are available through an application procedure. Along with personal details for the tickets itself,
		we ask applicants a few questions about what they do in tech, or what they wish to learn on the event.
		These answers are helpful for the jury, who will evaluate the applications and award the tickets.
	</p>

	<p>The budget for these tickets will be put together by sponsoring companies and individuals, who buy <em>Diversity Sponsoring</em> tickets.</p>

	<h3 id="why">Why?</h3>

	<p>
			Diversity Sponsorship is not money for a party, nor for fancy catering, or a nice booth. It is a chance for someone.
	</p>
	<p>
			We try to reach as much people as possible, in the community around the region, and we are working hard,
			to make this event available for everyone who is interested. But we know there are many in the region who would,
			but cannot attend such a conference, for various reasons. They can get a ticket to the conference, through application.
	</p>

	<blockquote>
		This is a chance for them, to meet people they can learn from, see talks they can benefit from, a chance to step forward
	</blockquote>

	<p>
			A chance for you to help someone in a great way for a reasonable price.
	</p>
	<p>
			Last year, after we started this program, <a href="https://medium.com/@_nec/how-can-a-conference-help-someone-5a4fff2623af#.gw1ni84hj">we've actually changed someone's life for good!</a>
			Imagine what is possible by helping with even more people!
	</p>


	<h3 id="supported-tickets">Diversity Sponsoring tickets</h3>

	<p>
		Both Early Bird and Regular tickets are available in a Diversity Sponsoring variant.
		This means, that the ticket price includes a percent of a supported ticket, that will be given to someone in need.
	</p>

	<p>
		Let's see this ticket for example:
	</p>

	<blockquote>
		Regular Coder Ticket + 50% Diversity Sponsorship - <strong>€402</strong><br />
		<small><strong>200 EUR + 100 EUR</strong> + VAT + Fees</small>
	</blockquote>

	<p>
		This means, if you buy this ticket, you'll sponsor the half of someone's ticket, who otherwise could not afford it.
	</p>

	<p>
		We've set several levels of sponsorship: 25%, 50%, 75% (for early birds) and 100%.
	</p>

	<h3 id="awarding">Awarding process</h3>

	<p>We, the organizers, do not decide who gets these tickets. We will assemble an international jury of individuals,
	who work hard to improve diversity in tech. They will handle the awarding process, by choosing from the applications for the tickets.</p>

	<h3 id="privacy">Privacy</h3>

	<p><em>The conference is also determined to provide a safe enviroment for all attendees. We guarantee that the applicants privacy, details, answers remain protected.</em></p>

	<p><em>We wont share any data with those, who provide these Diversity Supported tickets.</em></p>
